# Predictive Text Generator

## Description
This is a Python Predictive Text Generator created as part of my Algonive internship.
It employs a basic N-gram model (bigram/trigram) for predicting the next word depending on user input.
The program also dynamically adapts to learn from new input and optionally store them for subsequent predictions.
